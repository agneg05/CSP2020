    <h3> This was our project. You are traveling through space but there are aliens in your way. The objective of the game is to shoot down as many aliens as possible. Move the ship using the WASD keys and press space to fire. You get a point for every alien hit, but avoid hitting satellites: those are minus one point for every time you hit them! The objects explode upon getting hit. Your score is displayed in the top left and the game is stopped when the aliens hit your ship or reach the bottom of the screen</h3>

    <h3> This was our project. 5 Pokémon randomly generate on the screen and move around at random time intervals, disappearing and reappearing in a new location. Use the A and D keys to move Ash left and right, and the space key to throw. After the ball is successfully thrown at the Pokémon, there is about a 30% chance that it will break free, shown by a flash of light, and around a 70% chance that it will stay in the ball, which is shown by an animation of a ball closing. Afterwards, a new Pokémon generates at a new location. You have unlimited poké balls, but only thirty seconds to catch as many Pokémon as you can. You get one point for every Pokémon caught. When the game ends, the screen is cleared and a Game Over screen displays your score. </h3>
